Ten months after the riot which caused several deaths among officers and prisoners, Em City reopens. 
McManus really wishes that everything goes well. 
He has two ideas in particular. 
First, he decides to form an inmate council so as to give everyone the opportunity to express themselves, and avoid another riot.
Second, he also begins an education program because he thinks that having a diploma will give the inmates a better chance to reintegrate the society after their prison term. 
Unfortunately, this initiative doesn't work as well as planned for reasons coming from inside the prison but also from the outside. 
Inside the prison, the example of Kenny is relevant. 
He doesn't know how to read and as a consequence life after prison will be very difficult for him, he risks of opting for dealing drugs instead of having a legal job and therefore risks to be sent to prison again. 
McManus succeeds in making him aware of this situation, and he is therefore very motivated to attend class. 
But his pretended friend Adebisi forces him to skip class. 
He wants to keep having an influence on him and feels that it won't be the case anymore if he is educated. 
Like many characters in this season, Kenny faces a dilemma but will finally choose to attend class. 
In spite of these difficulties, McManus' initiative hasn't failed as it enables some prisoners to get a diploma they wouldn't have had otherwise. 
The obstacle to this project coming from outside comes from the governor himself. 
After the first session, he decides to stop the project which costs too much. 
He thinks that people -and voters- don't care about the well-being of the prisoners, so he prefers to spend the money on something else.

McManus is not the only one who really wants to give the prisoners a chance. 
One of the prisoner, Kareem Said also does his best to help the other inmates. 
He tries to become Augustus' lawyer, an inmate, to free him, but unfortunately he failed. 
However, with McManus, he succeeds in freeing the inmate nicknamed Poet for his love of writing poems. 
Kareem uses his relationship with a publisher to get some of his poems published. 
Poet becomes a bit famous, and with the press influence, he gets paroled early. 
Unfortunately he will quickly be sent back to prison as he will use the money from his books to buy drugs, and he will end up killing a drug dealer about to shoot him down.

In the second season a lot of other things happen to the characters.
One of them called Alvarez also faces a dilemma. 
He initially was the leader of the Latinos but now risks to be excluded from the gang by Hernandez, a charismatic newcomer who has quickly become the new leader. 
Hernandez gives him two options : either he is dishonoured and excluded, and with no protection from a gang, he will die soon, or he cuts off the Rivera's eyes, one of the officer. 
This second option makes him risk solitary confinement or maybe the death row. 
He finally decides to cut off the Rivera's eyes, but cannot live with no other perspective than solitary confinement and attempts suicide.

Another prisoner, Ryan O'Reily, finds out that he has a breast cancer. 
This is all the more difficult to admit because not only is he weak, but he also risks to be laughed at as breast cancer is very unusual for a man. 
Of course, being laughed at in Oz means things really worse than everywhere else, he even risks for his life. 
The main doctor of the prison called Dr Nathan succeeds in saving him. 
He is relieved and falls completely in love with Dr Nathan. 
This one tells him that she can't love him because she has a husband. 
Ryan wants to get rid of this and asks his brother Cyril to kill Dr Nathan's husband. 
This murder will lead Cyril to the same prison as his brother.

Another prisoner called Tobias Beecher has been the victim of Schillinger, one of the Aryans, since he arrived in Oz. 
This one has humiliated and raped him. 
As Schillinger can be released on parole, Tobias sees an opportunity to take revenge by sabotaging his parole. 
He does everything he can to make Schillinger so crazy that he wants to kill him. 
Schillinger asks Diane, one of the officer, to kill Tobias in return for some money, thinking that she would agree. 
But Diane denounces him, which ruins for him the hope of being released on parole. 
From that moment, Schillinger hates Tobias more than ever and decides of a plan with Chris Keller, an old friend of him who has just arrived in Oz. 
The idea is to make Tobias drink alcohol as the dependence on alcohol is the cause of all his problems, and in particular his imprisonment (he was drunk and killed a girl in a car accident). 
If he starts drinking again, he will destroy himself. 
Chris plays a role and gets closer to Tobias until Tobias falls in love with him. 
Then, he lets him down. 
Tobias is devastated, starts to drink and becomes weak. 
As he is in a very fragile position, he is caught into a trap by Schillinger and Chris Keller who reveals to him that he has never loved him, humiliates him, and finally breaks his arms and legs. 
He is mentally and physically destroyed.
