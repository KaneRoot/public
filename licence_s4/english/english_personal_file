Week from 6 to 13 of October. 
I watched several episodes of series "Oz" in original version. At least, 2 episodes a day, an episode last 55 minutes.
It's difficult to say which word in particular I learned. 
But what I'm sure about is, by listening to English every day, I get used to hearing this sound, and I understand better when an American is talking.

I also watched a lot of pictures on blogs like "cyanide & happiness" or on imageboards (4chan) and I learned some words or expressions like :
	-	"You're tripping me" (tu me gênes),
	-	"I find her impossible to wear" (je la trouve insupportable),
	-	"to wear out" (s'user),
	-	"gathering" (réunion, rassemblement),
	-	"nail" (clou),
	-	"to wear off" (se dissiper, passer) -> "I was shocked, but that wore off after a week or two."
	-	"fathom" (comprendre) -> "I couldn't fathom, either."
	-	"to be maxed out" (être saturé)
2h30.

The 9th of October 2011 : I watched the first episode of the series "Breaking Bad" in English with English subtitles.
I learn the expressions "admission of guilt" and "in custody" (en détention).
