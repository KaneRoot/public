Weel from 6 to 13 of october : 
I watched several episodes of serie "Oz" in original version. At least, 2 episodes a day.
It's difficult to say which word in particular I learned. 
But what I'm sure about is, by listening to English every day, I get used to hearing this sound, and I understand better when an american is talking.

The 9 of october 2011 : I watched the first episode of the serie "Breaking Bad" in English with english subtitles.
I learn the expression "admission of guilt", "law enforcement entitles" and "in custody".
