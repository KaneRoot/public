Weel from 6 to 13 of october : I watched several episodes of serie "Oz" in original version. At least, 2 episodes a day.
It's difficult to say which word in particular I learned. But what I'm sure about is, by listening to English every day, I get used to hearing this sound, and I understand better when an american is talking.
