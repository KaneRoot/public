With this technology, anyone can publish their own book. I really don't know if 'Penguin' is a good thing, but given that I am not intending to publish a book, I'm not the target of this company. People who want to publish a book would be more in a position than me to give a relevant opinion.
10 minutes.

I read this article : http://www.leidinger.net/blog/category/freebsd/jails/
It is about BSDs operating systems and their "jail" system, to secure the system from an attack on a service. If an application is compromised, the system is safe. It's like "LXC" (Linux Containers) on Linux based systems.

I watched a video and read the main page of the "reprap" project : reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page .

We can "print" some useful objects, like a hat rack for example.
About 15 minutes.
