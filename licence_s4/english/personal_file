I watched 25 episodes of the series "Lost" (~42 minutes each) in English with French subtitles. I have already watched this serie, but this time I decided to watch it again not only to enjoy the story, but above all to hear the characters talking, and try not to take a look at the subtitles.

I read an article -and comments- on shareable.net which explains "the Project Shellter". It is the idea to use 3D printers to make shells for a marine species.
But the article says also that it could just be an ad for 3D printers, the beaches don't deserve to be polluted with waste plastics.
30 minutes.

I read this webpage : http://www.shredderchallenge.com/Default.aspx
It's about some war documents which were destroyed (shredded). The project is to find a way to fix these. The one who will have computer skills enough to succeed, can gain $50,000.
I learned :
        -       "remnant" (reste),

We can "print" some useful objects, like a hat rack for example.
About 15 minutes.
