Season 1 :
The first season begins with a plane crash on a tropical island, apparently deserted.
The survivors have different reactions: some freak out, others try to find their suitcases, or to steal one, but most of them try to help each others...
Among the passengers we discover the main characters. We learn a lot about them throughout the flashbacks that punctuate each episode, and that give details on the characters lives before the crash. 
The first reaction of the survivors was of course to wait for help but they quickly learn that the pilot had veered off, so they have no idea of where they are, they are "lost".
What's more, the radio doesn't work, they have no way to communicate.
Very quickly the survivors find out handcuffs and understand that a fugitive is among them, someone potentially very dangerous.
The mutual aid quick turns into suspicion, fear and violence.
Guns are found out but quickly hided.
Survivors don't trust each others anymore, and fear is constantly there, as they hear some strange and unexplained noises.
The story takes place on a tropical island, the characters are therefore very surprised to see... a polar bear! 
They are also frightened by an unseen creature that they call "the Monster" and that kills the pilot in the first episode.
They are also suspicious towards the inhabitants of the island that they first thought to be deserted.
They called these inhabitants "the Others" and try to avoid them.
They also find a metal hatch buried in the ground, but have a hard time to open it. In the meantime, some passengers decide to construct a raft to leave the island.

Season 2 :
The "Others" threaten the survivors as they don't want them to be on their territory.
Many mysteries hold the spectators in suspense.
Whenever one is resolved, it is replaced by another one, most of the time at the end of an episode, so that people feel like watching the next one...
We see how life is organized on the island, and we notice how the control of guns and medicines gives a different status to everyone.
The leader is the one was has the guns, the others have to obey.
Little by little, they forget about democratic principles, it is the "law of the jungle".  
The survivors finally find a way to open the hatch, and find out it was a research station built by the "Dharma Initiative", an old scientific research project.
They are surprised to meet Desmond, a man that has lived in the hatch for some years, pushing a button every 108 minutes "to prevent a catastrophic event from occurring", even though he has no idea of what could really happen.
He is not even sure that something would happen, but he doesn't want to take any risks.

Season 3 :
In this season, the survivors finally succeed in making contact with a rescue team aboard a freighter.
We continue to learn more about the characters, the Others and the survivors (who continue to fight), in particular thanks to the flashbacks.
At the end of the season, a very unusual idea is introduced, which will be often used in the following seasons : the flash-forwards.
This is unnerving for the spectators who are not used to this concept. Most of the time, they have to guess if the scene is a flash forwards or backwards.
This gives an interesting puzzle for the spectators, who can imagine the different links between the scenes.  

Season 4 :
In the fourth season, people from the freighter arrive on the island, but the survivors realise that their goal is not rescuing them.
Their real objective is quite mysterious, but they are really interested by the island itself and its secrets... 
But, no matter what, the survivors are determined to use the freighter to leave the island for good.
Some of them finally succeed to escape.
In the meantime, one of the Others is convinced that the island is endangered, and want to move the island (in the literal meaning).
He succeeds, and move the island not only physically, but also to another point in time.

Season 5 :
This season is divided into 2 parts.
The first one focuses on the characters that haven't left the island.
They went back in time, and are now in 1974, at the time of the Dharma Initiative.
The second part takes place nowadays, and focuses on the survivors who succeeded in leaving the island.
They have a hard time forgetting about the island and especially about the other survivors who were left behind.
They feel that they have to go back there, which they finally did 3 years after.
They are all together in the same plane that crashes on the island.
Some passengers land in 1977, some others remain in 2007.
Those who are in 1977 meet the survivors who have stayed on the island for 3 years.
Together they try to change past events so as to avoid the future plane crash.

Season 6 :
The sixth season, which is the final one, takes place nowadays, and the still alive characters are finally reunited.
We learn a lot about the past and the mission of Jacob, the island's protector.
The monster that the survivors feared is in fact Jacob's brother.
He has been trying to kill Jacob for years.
We understand that Jacob is the one that make the survivors come to the island.
He wants that one of them replaces him after his death.
Finally, Jacob is killed by his brother, and one of the survivors takes his place as the caretaker of the island.
At the end, we understand that some survivors will leave the island later, and that some others will stay.
This season introduces another unusual concept : the flash-sideways, in which we see how the life of each character would have been if the plane wouldn't have crashed.
