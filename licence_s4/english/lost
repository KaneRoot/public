Season 1 :
The first season begins with a plane crash on a tropical island, apparently deserted.
The survivors have different reactions: some freak out, others try to find their suitcases, or to steal one, but most of them try to help each others...
Among the passengers we discover the main characters. We learn a lot about them throughout the flashbacks that punctuate each episode, and that give details on the characters lives before the crash. 
The first reaction of the survivors was of course to wait for help but they quickly learn that the pilot had veered off, so they have no idea of where they are, they are "lost".
What's more, the radio doesn't work, they have no way to communicate.
Very quickly the survivors find out handcuffs and understand that a fugitive is among them, someone potentially very dangerous.
The mutual aid quick turns into suspicion, fear and violence.
Guns are found out but quickly hided.
Survivors don't trust each others, and fear is constantly there, as they hear some strange and unexplained noises.
The story takes place on a tropical island, the characters are therefore very surprised to see... a polar bear! 
They are also frightened by an unseen creature that they call "the Monster" and that kills the pilot in the first episode.
Finally they are suspicious towards the inhabitants of the island that they first thought to be deserted.
They called these inhabitants "the Others" and try to avoid them.
They also find a metal hatch buried in the ground, but have a hard time to open it. In the meantime, some passengers decide to construct a raft to leave the island.

Season 2 :
The second season follows the growing conflict between the survivors and the Others, and continues the theme of the clash between faith and science, while resolving old mysteries and posing new ones.
A power struggle between Jack and John over control of the guns and medicine in the hatch develops, resolved in "The Long Con" by the machinations of Sawyer when he gains control of them.
New characters are introduced, including the tail-section survivors (the "Tailies") and other island inhabitants.
The hatch is revealed to be a research station built by the Dharma Initiative, a scientific research project that was conducting experiments on the island decades earlier.
A man named Desmond Hume has been living in the hatch for 3 years, pushing a button every 108 minutes to prevent a catastrophic event from occurring.
As the truth about the mysterious Others begins to unfold, one of the crash survivors betrays the other castaways, and the cause of the plane crash is revealed.

Season 3 :
In the third season, the crash survivors learn more about the Others and their long history on the mysterious island.
Desmond and one of the Others join the survivors, while one of their number in turn defects to the Others.
A war between the Others and the survivors comes to a head, and the survivors make contact with a rescue team aboard the freighter Kahana.

Season 4 :
Season four focuses on the survivors dealing with the arrival of people from the freighter, who have been sent to the island not as part of a rescue operation, but for far more nefarious purposes.
The reason specifically for the freighter folks being there is revealed.
The survivors begin planning a way to get off the island before the freighter crew can carry out their plan.
Flashforwards reveal the identities and future actions of the so-called "Oceanic Six," a group of survivors who have escaped the island and attempted to resume their normal lives.
In an attempt to "move the island" to safety, one of the others uses an ancient device on the island that not only moves the island physically but also moves it to another point in time, while simultaneously teleporting that other to a desert in Tunisia.

Season 5 :
The fifth season follows two timelines.
The first takes place on the island where the survivors who were left behind erratically jump forward and backward through time until they are finally stranded with the Dharma Initiative in 1974.
The second continues the original timeline, which takes place on the mainland after the Oceanic Six escape, and then follows their return to the island on Ajira Airways flight 316 in 2007 (three years after they escaped).
Some passengers on the Ajira flight land in 1977 and some remain in 2007.
The ones who land in 1977 reunite with the other survivors who have lived for three years with the Dharma Initiative.
They then attempt to change past events in order to prevent their plane from crashing in the future.

Season 6 :
In the sixth & final season, the main storyline follows the survivors, reunited in the present day.
Following the demise of Jacob, the island's protector, the survivors are up against the Man in Black, known previously as the Smoke Monster.
A "flash-sideways" narrative also follows the lives of the main characters in a setting where Oceanic 815 never crashed.
In the final episodes, a flashback to the distant past shows the origins of the island's power and of the conflict between Jacob and the Man in Black, who are revealed to be twin brothers.
One survivor becomes the successor to Jacob as caretaker of the island, and kills the Man in Black in a final showdown, with the island at stake.
A small handful of survivors escape on the Ajira plane.
It is implied that a few survivors return home later, while others remain living happily on the island.
The series finale reveals that the flash-sideways timeline is actually a form of limbo, where some of the survivors and other characters from the island are reunited after having died because their time on the island had been the most important part of their existence.
In the end the survivors are all reunited in a church where they "move on" together.
