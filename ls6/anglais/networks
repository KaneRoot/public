Is networking discipline or a domain ?
Neither. It's a notion, so it's really near to the discipline but includes a lot of domains.
So, in my opinion this is a huge set of disciplines and domains. 
We cannot choose one of them, it's both and more. 
Networking could not be assimilated to the computer science, we have a network whenever we have an interaction.

What is the difference between networking and distributed systems ?
There is no difference.
Distributed systems is a networking usage. 
We know and we work with the fact that a system is connected to others.
Networking is the fact that systems are in interaction.
Why this interaction ? To work together and provide a service (like e-mail service) to people or speak more technically to share data.
Sharing data allows to share more (or more specific in the computing science) like calculation time.
And it's the definition of distributed systems !

Could you find your own recipe for writing a paper on a networking problem ?
Obviously. Presently I'm the president of an associative Internet Service Provider, so I could talk a lot about the networking.
And if technically I'm not as good as we could expect, I think I've a lot to say about the social aspect, and more specifically about some kind of censorship we face everyday even in France.

What is "definition and placement of function" ?
It's the separation between what an host or the network should do.
I'm very concerned about this subject, in particular about some functionalities that I don't want to see on Internet network.
Like the possibility to know what is shared between people, to control who can access to a website and who can't.
This access control should be on the host (the server) and not on the network. There is a lot to say about this.

What is the major change due to recent innovations ?
Cloud computing is a marketing term, nothing more, but there are some real innovations like the virtual machines, and others.
To talk about the virtual machines, it allows us to manage more efficiently our services, and this could widespread the use of services at home, instant installation service, hardware agnostic.
This is an improvement but can we talk about major change ? I don't really know.

In my opinion, the major change is the hardware improvement. 
With this change, some companies have drawn people attention to their services (like e-mailing, Google with Gmail for instance) and they are able to provide these services freely but this is a totally centralized architecture.
Before that, people had their e-mailing service on their own computer because nobody could do it for you efficiently and it was logic. 
You don't give your letters to La Poste to keep them.
So even if every single laptop can nowadays be sufficient to build an ISP, manage e-mails for thousand people and a lot more at the same time, people still use a centralized service that watches their own letters.
In conclusion, the hardware improvement allows to re-create the minitel, people are becoming « eye balls », passive.

What are we doing ?
The future of Internet, and more.

Why networking is so cool ?
Networking is not only the Internet, but
