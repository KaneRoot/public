Bayesian network is based on the Bayes' theorem that we already talked about in class.
This Bayesian, or « belief », network has the purpose to show some conditional probabilities and causalities relationships between variables.
The variables are often events.
What is called « conditional probability » is the probability of an event occurring given that another event occured before.
We can found some representations of this kind of networks on the internet, like this :

SCHEMA

The circles are called « nodes » and contains the variable name.
There are links (arrows) between them, which are called « arcs » and they represent a dependence. 
In a Bayesian network, only the variables without arrows are independant.
With this figure (from wikipedia), we have the « sprinkler » which is the child of the variable « rain ».
« Grass wet » is caused by one (or more) of its parents.
Bayesian networks are acyclic.
