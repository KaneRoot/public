Bayesian network theory can be thought of as a fusion of incidence diagrams and Bayes’ theorem. 
A Bayesian network, or belief network, shows conditional probability and causality relationships between variables. 
The probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred is called a conditional probability. 
The probabilistic model is described qualitatively by a directed acyclic graph, or DAG. 
The vertices of the graph, which represent variables, are called nodes. The nodes are represented as circles containing the variable name. 
The connections between the nodes are called arcs, or edges. The edges are drawn as arrows between the nodes, and represent dependence between the variables. 
Therefore, for any pairs of nodes indicate that one node is the parent of the other so there are no independence assumptions. 
Independence assumptions are implied in Bayesian networks by the absence of a link. Here is a sample DAG: 

Bayesian network is based on the Bayes' theorem that we already talked about in class.
This Bayesian, or « belief », network has the purpose to show some conditional probabilities and causalities relationships between variables.
The variables are often events.
What is called « conditional probability » is the probability of an event occurring given that another event occured before.
We can found some representations of this kind of networks on the internet, like this :

The circles are called « nodes » and contains the variable name.
