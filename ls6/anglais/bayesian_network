Bayesian network is based on the Bayes' theorem that we already talked about in class.
This model is probabilistic and is mainly used in data mining, in medical and industrial diagnostic and in spam detection.
This Bayesian, or « belief », network has the purpose to show conditional probabilities and causalities relationships between variables.
The variables can be events, or states.
What is called « conditional probability » is the probability of an event occurring given that another event occurred before.
We can found some representations of this kind of networks (acyclic graphs) on the internet, like this :

SCHEMA

The circles are called « nodes » and contains the variable name.
There are links (arrows) between them, which are called « arcs » and they represent a dependence. 
In a Bayesian network, only the variables without arrows are independent.
With this figure (from Wikipedia), we have the « sprinkler » which is the child of the variable « rain ».
« Grass wet » is caused by one (or more) of its parents.
With the graph, we can make a table with the probability of an event occurs or not given the fact that an other event is occurred before or not.
The grass has a great probability of being wet if the event « rain » occurs, less if not.

The graph is the first step in the construction of a Bayesian network, 
then we can take statistics to determinate a table of probabilities for each variable from the structure, 
conditionally to their dependences.
