OZ
Oswald State Correctional Facility

"Oz" is an american serie based on a fictional maximum-security prison (level 4).
Its broadcasting has been finished for several years, but I started to watch this serie very recently.

This prison has a particular unit where the prisoners can learn responsability in doing some tasks, like cooking, to prepare them to be rehabilited.
Most of these people are there for the rest of their life. They can easily be killed for some obscur reason.
There is no main character, which is pretty unique for a serie. Instead, there are some gangs who are defined by their ethnic identity.
The spoken language is based on the prison jargon but there are many things who are described by the narrator, a wheelchar-using man who's also a prisoner.

I don't have hindsight as this is my first time writing in my « personal file », so I'm not sure the text length is appropriate. If not, and in particular if it is too short, I will endeavour to give more details next time.
